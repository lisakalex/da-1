<p>The Starknet Foundation has unveiled plans to distribute 1.8 billion STRK token rewards and rebates to drive the adoption and growth of the Starknet blockchain.</p>
<p>While specific distribution plan details are not provided, the Foundation intends to involve various committees to oversee the overall allocation of the L2 tokens.</p>
<p>In a D<a href="https://twitter.com/StarknetFndn/status/1733101666357100992?s=20">ecember 8 announcement</a> on X (formerly Twitter), the Foundation highlighted the role of the &#8220;Provisions Committee,&#8221; a distinct committee within its ecosystem, in managing the distribution of rewards to users and community members. It added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The committee&#8217;s objective is to distribute ownership of the network&#8217;s native token and to reward past and future contributions by users and community members. We&#8217;ve been working on the first phase of distributions for a while now, and we are close to getting this over the line. There&#8217;ll be more formal communications on this soon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The committee will disburse 900 million STRK tokens in stages to acknowledge both past and future contributions made by users and community members. This distribution phase is set to commence in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>In addition to this allocation for user rewards, an equivalent amount has been designated for user rebates.</p>
<p>The Foundation revealed that a new committee dedicated to overseeing the distribution of STRK is in the process of formation. This committee will focus on rewarding users for significant transactions conducted on the Starknet network.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In addition to establishing two committees tasked with managing the distribution of 1.8 billion STRK tokens, the Foundation has introduced a third group known as the &#8220;DeFi Committee.&#8221;</p>
<p>This group has been allocated an initial 50 million STRK to explore direct, indirect, and retroactive incentivization. The focus is on fostering increased liquidity, higher trading volumes, and overall growth within the Starknet <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/introduction-decentralized-finance-defi.htm">Decentralized Finance</a> (DeFi) ecosystem.</p>

<p>Digital collectibles or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are currently experiencing a resurgence despite the ongoing bullish momentum in the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>Capturing this shift, DappRadar&#8217;s November industry report revealed that the NFT ecosystem has sustained a positive trend for the second consecutive month.</p>
<p>According to the decentralized application (dApp) monitoring platform, the digital collectible ecosystem <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/dapp-activity-soars-to-3-4-million-nfts-close-on-1-billion#Chapter-4">witnessed an impressive</a> 125% surge in trading volume in November.</p>

<p>This remarkable rally has seen it gross nearly $1 billion in trading volume within the stated month.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, this is not the only impressive data captured from the digital collectible ecosystem.</p>
<p>DappRadar also reported a modest 5% increase in sales, contributing to a total transaction output of 3.6 million in November.</p>
<p>This indicates that NFT investors are increasingly active in buying and selling their favorite pixelated blockchain-based assets at premium values.</p>
<p>The average transaction value has notably risen from $126 in October to $270 in November, representing a 114% increase within a 30-day period.</p>
<p>Additionally, Unique Asset Wallets (UAWs) have seen substantial growth, particularly in on-chain gaming, which reached 3.4 million UAWs, reflecting a 14% increase while holding a 34% industry dominance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DappRadar highlights the significant turnaround in the fortunes of the decentralized economy in the last three months.</p>
<p>Following a broader interest in offering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-talks-have-advanced-to-key-details-report.htm">exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF) services for the two most popular cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) by several legacy-backed asset management firms, the crypto market has experienced a resurgence.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, the chief catalyst in the market&#8217;s uptrend, has broken through its $30,000 shackles and now sits comfortably above the $40,000 price peg in less than a month while recording over 150% increase year-to-date (YTD).</p>
<p>This remarkable rally has seen the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">crypto market</a> climb to $1.6 trillion in its market cap within the stated period. Nonetheless, the NFT sector has also demonstrated notable progress in recent months.</p>

<p>The Blur NFT marketplace accounted for 171,926 ETH, surpassing OpenSea&#8217;s 37,765 ETH during the same period.</p>
<h2>Blur Leads NFT Sector Again</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The NFT ecosystem relies heavily on on-chain marketplaces, which provide an avenue for NFT buyers and sellers to transact smoothly.</p>
<p>The NFT marketplace ecosystem was previously dominated by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-marketplace-opensea-to-reduce-workforce-as-it-is-planning-big-changes.htm">OpenSea</a> platform. However, DappRadar&#8217;s report continues to pinpoint that OpenSea&#8217;s competitor, Blur, is still giving it a run for its money.</p>
<p>According to the dApp platform, the<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-sales-spike-to-129m-in-november-with-blur-leading-the-charge-nansen.htm"> Blur NFT</a> marketplace leads the NFT sector with a 35% market share in trading volume.</p>

<p>Centralized crypto trading platform OKX comes a close second with 32%, while OpenSea comes with a third platform runner-up with a yearly low of 14% of trades executed on its platform.</p>
<p>However, it still has an active community of 191,000 NFT traders. This report shows that OpenSea is becoming fazed out by new entrants like the Blur NFT platform.</p>

<p>Russian digital settlement exchange Exved has officially debuted with the goal of empowering local legal entities to conduct cross-border digital payment services using Tether&#8217;s USDT.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russia&#39;s Exved platform launches as one of the first cross-border payment solutions enabling local legal entities to conduct international settlements in crypto.</p>

<p>&mdash; BrownRice Capital (@brownricecap) <a href="https://twitter.com/brownricecap/status/1732742932191379771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In its <a href="https://t.me/exved/5">announcement on Telegram</a> to mark the launch, Exved explained that it operates through a business-to-business (B2B) electronic platform that enables Russian importers and exporters to place and execute offshore orders.</p>
<p>The project aims to streamline cross-border payments for Russian legal entities without the need for intermediaries, all at minimal market rates.</p>
<p>The exchange exclusively collaborates with legal entities, ensuring compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CFT) measures. It integrates non-resident (offshore) rubles, US dollars, and USDT for settlements.</p>
<p>Beyond simplifying international payments, the B2B solution offers complimentary services for legal transaction documentation and acts as an escrow agent.</p>
<p>The exchange&#8217;s launch involves the participation of well-known brokers in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bank-of-france-deputy-governor-views-cbdcs-as-a-catalyst-for-cross-border-payments.htm">cross-border payment</a> market. Additionally, technical specialists from InDeFi Bank, which launched a decentralized rubble project in 2022, are actively engaged in this initiative.</p>
<h2>Exved Receives Greenlight from Bank of Russia</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On December 7, Sergey Mendeleev, the co-founder and CEO of InDeFi Smart Bank, exclusively told Cointelegraph that the internal work structure of Exved has undergone testing.</p>
<p>The CEO noted that the project has also obtained approval from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/number-of-russians-trading-crypto-is-falling-says-central-bank.htm">Bank of Russia</a> and the Federal Financial Monitoring Service of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>While Exved primarily targets a Russian audience, Mendeleev underscored its broader purpose – to demonstrate that individuals can conduct transactions with lower fees, paying 2–3% instead of the typical 6–7%.</p>
<p>The project also seeks to introduce specific mechanisms for implementing payment requests, enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in financial transactions.</p>
<p>The approval from regulatory bodies adds credibility to Exved, reinforcing its commitment to compliance and regulatory standards within the Russian financial landscape.</p>
<p>The inception of Exved aligns with the agreement reached in September 2022 between the Russian central bank and the country&#8217;s Ministry of Finance to facilitate cross-border settlements in digital assets.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>The FTX 2.0 customer ad hoc committee of the now-defunct crypto exchange has received a response to the letter sent to its official arm.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://document.epiq11.com/document/getdocumentbycode/?docId=4265339&amp;projectCode=FTX">letter dated December 4, 2023</a>, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (UCC), overseeing the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange, acknowledged the concerns raised by its ad hoc arm.</p>
<p>Led by Ken Pasquale of Paul Hastings LLP, the UCC stated that it is actively working behind the scenes to ensure an expeditious bankruptcy process.</p>
<p>Regarding unsecured creditors, the committee mentioned considering the option of &#8220;recovering rights tokens&#8221; to maximize their return on value. However, it indicated that specific details would remain confidential due to legal obligations.</p>
<p>While both committees are exploring avenues to assist investors defrauded following the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-had-dinner-with-nyc-mayor-prior-ftx-collapse-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">collapse</a> of the Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)-led platform, the UCC confirmed divergent views on how assets should be valued and redistributed in the reorganization plan.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the committee aims to submit an amended reorganization plan to the Bankruptcy Court in mid-December.</p>
<p>This is expected to provide further details on the committee&#8217;s recommendations. However, it stated that it is open to exploring other reasonable alternatives that can improve the terms of the proposed plan.</p>
<p>The letter also touched on the subject of a potential acquisition by a third party, indicating that the process is still ongoing.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-launches-strategic-review-of-its-global-assets-301683269.html">November 2022 press release</a>, FTX announced engaging Perella Weinberg Partners (PWP) as a lead investment bank in preparation for sale or reorganization. However, the purchase by PWP is still subject to the court&#8217;s approval.</p>
<p>This announcement was made following the kickstarting of the bankruptcy proceedings. The press release also revealed that 101 of its 130 affiliated companies would undergo a global strategic asset review.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Sharing a Press Release issued early today &#8211; </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Addressing this event, Mr. John J. Ray III, serving as the interim CEO of FTX, said that he has instructed the team at FTX Debtors to prioritize the preservation of franchise value.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I respectfully ask all employees, vendors, customers, regulators, and government stakeholders to be patient with us as we put in place the arrangement that corporate governance failures at FTX prevented us from putting in place prior to filing our Chapter 11 cases,&#8221; Ray added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the global asset review revealed that many of the exchange&#8217;s affiliates have solvent balance sheets, putting them in a viable position to continue operating.</p>
<h2>Regulators Welcome FTX Reboot</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite the historically challenging stance of US government agencies towards crypto-related companies, there seems to be a potential shift in sentiment towards the emerging industry.</p>
<p>Speaking in a CNBC special appearance, US <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-talks-have-advanced-to-key-details-report.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) head Gary Gensler expressed openness to a possible FTX reboot in the future.</p>
<p>According to the former blockchain professor at MIT, the return of FTX would be a welcome development as long as it aligns with legal regulations.</p>

<p>Utilizing blockchain technology, particularly Avalanche, ensures the certificates are tamper-proof and reflects the adoption of blockchain for securing and verifying academic or professional milestones.</p>
<p>According to a December 6 report by Cointelegraph, India holds the second-largest membership base for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outside the United States, with over 75,000 members.</p>
<p>To enhance the verification process for its extensive trainee and user base, IEEE will issue tamper-proof, instant, and secure certificates using <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-blockchain-technology-empowers-law-enforcement-crypto-investigations.htm">blockchain technology</a>.</p>
<p>Devika Mittal, head of Avalanche&#8217;s India arm, underscored Avalanche&#8217;s EVM compatibility as a facilitator for deploying widely used applications such as credential registries and identity management.</p>
<p>She also highlighted the preference of esteemed institutions like SK Planet and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-report-highlights-resurgence-in-defi-and-nft-sectors.htm">JPMorgan</a> Onyx for Avalanche, emphasizing the importance of selecting a blockchain solution based on its ability to ensure immutability, longevity, and security.</p>
<p>These blockchain certificates will be managed through LegitDoc, a credential lifecycle management system developed by Zupple Labs and deployed on <a href="https://subnets.avax.network/c-chain">Avalanche&#8217;s C-Chain</a>.</p>
<p>Neil Martis, co-founder of Zupple, also emphasized the growing willingness of the Indian public sector to implement comprehensive blockchain projects. The choice of Avalanche&#8217;s C-Chain as the primary settlement layer is attributed to its compatibility with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/federico-kunze-kullmer-evmos-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-on-cosmos-437.htm">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM).</p>
<p>Martis expressed openness to exploring new platforms as additional parallel settlement layers as suitable technology emerges.</p>
<h2>Deep Dive: Blockchain &amp; Education as a Powerful Duo</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Blockchain technology has significantly impacted education, enhancing transparency, security, and efficiency.</p>
<p>An exemplary use case is the creation of blockchain-based certificates for skills and achievements, a feat accomplished by IEEE through the Avalanche ecosystem.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional paper certificates, which are susceptible to fraud and can be cumbersome to verify, blockchain allows educational institutions to issue digital certificates that are tamper-proof and easily verifiable. This mitigates the risks associated with credential fraud.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">IEEE and Avalanche teaming up to issue blockchain skill certificates? Looks like blockchain just got a &quot;certifiably&quot; cool upgrade! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Blockchain ensures that certificates are securely stored on a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-investor-interest-in-crypto-startups-is-low-in-2023-credefi-finance-integrates-with-xrp-ledger.htm">decentralized ledger</a>, creating a transparent and immutable record of individuals&#8217; academic and professional achievements.</p>
<p>This simplifies the verification process for employers and educational institutions and empowers individuals by granting them ownership of their credentials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, using blockchain for certificates opens up possibilities for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-decentralized-crypto-wallets.htm">decentralized</a> and interoperable education ecosystem. It facilitates the seamless transfer of credentials across institutions and international borders.</p>
<p>As technology advances, the potential for widespread adoption by more educational institutions becomes achievable.</p>
<p>This paradigm shift may usher in the establishment of decentralized education networks, granting learners control over their records and fostering a more inclusive global education system.</p>

The SEC went to a judge seeking an emergency order to paralyze several businesses and blatantly misrepresented facts to get it before anyone on the other side could defend themselves.</p>
<p>&mdash; David &quot;JoelKatz&quot; Schwartz (@JoelKatz) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/1731947352720867580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Schwartz expressed his shock at the revelations he uncovered while examining the Debt Box documents.</p>
<p>He highlighted that the top securities regulator obtained an emergency restraining order against the defendants by misrepresenting facts to the courts. This action was taken without allowing the defendants an opportunity to present a proper defense.</p>
<p>Given this breach, Schwartz claimed that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-asset-exchange-digift-secures-cms-and-rmo-license-from-singapore-monetary-authority.htm">SEC</a> inadvertently paralyzed several crypto businesses with this questionable conduct as funds were seized.</p>
<p>The Debt Box case, which kicked off in July 2023 following an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO), led to an illegal freeze of the defendants&#8217; assets without a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>According to its court filing with the US Court in the District of Utah, the SEC <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.141167/gov.uscourts.utd.141167.215.0.pdf">alleged that Digital Licensing Inc</a>., also known as Debt Box, defrauded investors of $50 million following its sales of unregistered securities, which they termed &#8220;node licenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Schwartz&#8217;s online outburst has led to a debate in the crypto and broader financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>Popular crypto legal practitioner John E. Deaton tweeted that the TRO application by the SEC meant Debt Box&#8217;s legal representatives were completely unaware, preventing them from challenging the agency&#8217;s claims.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that a TRO application is a 100% one-sided proceeding that eliminates the opposing counsel.</p>
<p>Deaton shed light on the behind-the-scenes events, revealing that the SEC argued notifying the defendants could prompt them to move the assets offshore, making it challenging to seize them and potentially harming affected investors.</p>
<p>As a result, Judge Netburn was convinced that the government agency was paying &#8220;faithful allegiance to the law,&#8221; leading to the approval of its application.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Debt Box case is a great example of why Judge Netburn felt COMPELLED to announce to the world that lawyers at the SEC “lack a faithful allegiance to the law” and do or say anything to advance its own agenda. </p>

The SEC has been the most engaged regulatory body in the crypto space. The Gary Gensler-led government body has continued to sue crypto-facing businesses and label several crypto assets as &#8220;securities.&#8221;</p>

<p>The regulatory body&#8217;s fervency has led to widespread questioning of its intentions, with Kraken CEO Jesse Powell going as far as characterizing it as the &#8216;US top decel&#8217; in a tweet on November 21, following yet <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-co-founder-jesse-powell-blasts-sec-as-top-decel-says-crypto-should-exit-us.htm">another regulatory move</a> against the centralized crypto operation.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to Powell, the SEC is intentionally hindering blockchain innovation in the country with its lack of regulatory clarity and enforcement actions.</p>

<p>The momentum of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States continues to intensify, with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) asserting its readiness to call out defaulting businesses.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Financial Times (FT) event, NYDFS Chief Adrienne Harris emphasized the regulator&#8217;s commitment to taking necessary enforcement actions against any cryptocurrency firm that fails to adhere to its stated guidelines.</p>
<p>The event, tagged &#8220;<a href="https://cryptowinter.live.ft.com/">Crypto and Digital Assets Summit: Winter Edition</a>,&#8221; is an annual conference that brings together leaders from traditional financial and blockchain ecosystems to share insights.</p>
<p>Notable figures from the <a href="https://cryptowinter.live.ft.com/page/2629333/speakers">industry and regulatory landscape</a>, including Binance&#8217;s CEO Richard Teng, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Kristin Johnson, Biswarup Chatterjee of CitiGroup, Sasha Mills of the Bank of England (BoE), among others, were in attendance.</p>
<p>Continuing her remarks, Harris highlighted that her priority upon assuming leadership at NYDFS was establishing clear guidelines, which she termed a &#8216;tone reset.&#8217;</p>
<p>This approach ensures crypto companies understand the regulator&#8217;s expectations regarding their operations to stay in its good books.</p>
<p>Referencing recent regulatory actions, Harris cited the concerted efforts by US agencies to address compliance issues with the Binance exchange.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been talking about the illicit finance component of cryptocurrencies. I think that&#8217;s going to continue, and attention on that is going to be heightened as a result of Binance and some of the other cases that have been brought by DOJ and other authorities around the world,&#8221; Harris said, referring to the US DoJ-led regulatory action against the Binance exchange.</p></blockquote>
<p>The world&#8217;s largest Bitcoin trading firm was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ex-binance-ceo-could-be-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison-according-to-doj.htm">recently fined</a> $4.3 billion for money laundering and other charges.</p>
<p>As part of the regulatory action, founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was asked to step down from his role as the CEO. CZ was also fined $50 million for his role in the entire situation.</p>
<p>NYDFS has already made a mark in recent years after initiating enforcement actions against Nasdaq-listed Coinbase and commission-free stock trading platform Robinhood.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">That one there was a violation </p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/coinbase?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#coinbase</a> was ordered to pay a $50M fine to regulators after the NYDFS discovered that it allowed customers to open accounts without doing full background checks. (This is a violation of Anti-money laundering laws).</p>
<p>Coinbase… <a href="https://t.co/0eGiLlE8zv">pic.twitter.com/0eGiLlE8zv</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the case of Coinbase, NYDFS alleged inadequate background checks on new customers, resulting in a $50 million fine for lack of proper know-your-customer (KYC) processes.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: New York&#39;s top financial regulator has imposed a $30 million fine on Robinhood&#39;s crypto trading unit, for allegedly failing to maintain anti-money laundering and cybersecurity programs.</p>
<p>This is the first, but unlikely the last, crypto-sector enforcement action by NYDFS</p>
<p>&mdash; Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioNawfal/status/1554465321972600834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Likewise, Robinhood was fined $30 million for allegedly violating anti-money laundering (AML) and cybersecurity regulations.</p>
<h2>Crypto Regulation Picking Up Pace Globally</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Regulatory action is picking up the pace globally as governments seek control over the burgeoning industry.</p>
<p>However, in the United States, there is currently no concerted regulatory framework that crypto businesses can reference.</p>
<p>In contrast, Europe, as the third-largest continent globally, has proactively moved to introduce essential clarity into the decentralized ecosystem <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica-framework-signed-into-law-by-eu-officials.htm">through</a> the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1114">MiCA</a>, which is based on existing EU rules for securities trading, is geared towards ensuring compliance across the ecosystem.</p>

<p>AXA Investment Managers and Generali Investments have recently joined the growing bandwagon of companies purchasing tokenized green bonds as the digitalization of real-world assets (RWAs) gains momentum.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.societegenerale.com/en/news/press-release/first-inaugural-digital-green-bond-public-blockchain">press release</a> by French banking giant Societe Generale, it issued its first digital green bond as a security token on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>The tokenized security token registered as SG-FORGE came with a 10 million Euro ($10.8 million) price peg during its official launch on November 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Now, Societe Generale has revealed that AXA Investment Managers and Generali Investments have fully subscribed through a private placement.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Generali Investments also participated in the operation with Axa IM</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Providing details behind the tokenization of its green bonds, Societe Generale stated that it is geared towards increasing transparency and traceability as well as improving fluidity and speed in transactions and settlement.</p>
<p>The RWA green bonds are described as unsecured with a maturity window of three years. Upon reaching the majority window, the net proceeds will be allocated to finance the banking giant’s Eligible Green Activities, as defined in its <a href="https://www.societegenerale.com/en/news/press-release/first-inaugural-digital-green-bond-public-blockchain#_ftn2">Sustainable and Positive Impact Bond</a> framework.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the onboarding of key institutional investors like AXA and Generali as a commendable achievement, Societe Generale emphasized that it is only a first step towards leveraging blockchain technology as a data repository to track ESG impact on a global scale.</p>
<p>Zooming in on its RWA green bonds, Societe Generale said it comes designed with two key innovations.</p>
<p>Firstly, a 24/7 data and reporting portal that provides real-time information on the digital bond infrastructure via the stated smart contract.</p>
<p>This portal will enable investors and issuers to measure the carbon emissions of their securities on the financial infrastructure.</p>
<p>The second innovation is an on-chain securities claiming solution named EUR CoinVertible, targeted as a complementary cash settlement solution.</p>
<p>Societe Generale also revealed that the on-chain securities claiming hub could be a testing ground for state-backed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-apex-banks-jump-on-e-cny-pilot-trial-program-the-rise-of-global-cbdc-issuance.htm">central bank digital currencies</a> (CBDCs) such as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-euro-debate-heats-up-experts-divided-on-central-bank-digital-currency.htm">digital euro</a>.</p>
<p>According to the financial institution, SG-FORGE’s fluidity shows its versatility to tackle real-world needs in the fast-growing decentralized economy.</p>
<h2>SG-FORGE Marker for Growing RWA Needs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Societe Generale has been a forerunner in the Positive Impact Bonds movement focused on the environment since 2015.</p>
<p>The French bank has since transmuted its vision into the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem, allowing ESG-minded investors and companies to tap into green bonds and join the movement for a more sustainable future.</p>
<p>However, Societe Generale is not alone in exploring the possibilities of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tokenization-of-investment-funds-now-permitted-in-the-uk-adoption-on-the-rise.htm">RWA tokenization</a>. On November 30, US banking giant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-explores-fund-tokenization-for-personalized-portfolio-management.htm">JPMorgan Chase</a> captured global attention by tokenizing funds and company shares.</p>
<p>This experimental effort leveraged the bank’s Onyx blockchain in collaboration with Axelar Network, Apollo Global, Provenance Blockchain Found (PBF), and digital securities infrastructure firm Oasis Pro.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">5&#x20e3; J.P. Morgan &amp; Apollo<a href="https://twitter.com/axelarnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@axelarnetwork</a> connected Onyx by <a href="https://twitter.com/jpmorgan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JPMorgan</a> systems to on-chain shares in <a href="https://twitter.com/apolloglobal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@apolloglobal</a> funds tokenized by <a href="https://twitter.com/provenancefdn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@provenancefdn</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/Oasis_Pro_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Oasis_Pro_</a> .</p>
<p>The result: Automated portfolio management proof-of-concept with tokenized assets &amp; auto-rebalancing across networks.</p>
<p>&mdash; Axelar Network (@axelarnetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/axelarnetwork/status/1730321291457307124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Through this initiative, JPMorgan and its partners successfully tokenized RWAs and automatically rebalanced digital funds across all supported networks.</p>
<p>This move signifies a growing awareness among legacy-backed financial institutions of the huge potential inherent in blockchain tech and the transformative possibilities it offers for reengineering financial processes.</p>

<p>Providing more details on this, the Web3 development solution firm said the MGS platform would solely focus on creating a state-of-the-art digitized and digital measurement, reporting, and verification (dMRV) framework for the carbon markets.</p>
<p>Envision noted that the MGS platform and the UN Climate Change Global Innovation Hub signify a new turn in the carbon markets space.</p>
<p>The platform will be powered by Hedera Hashgraph&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/distributed-digital-identity-using-blockchain-technology.htm">distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT) and its native coin, the HBAR asset, aiming to revolutionize the approach to addressing global climate change concerns.</p>
<p>According to the blockchain protocol, the MGS platform offers a full suite of features and products for this particular purpose.</p>
<p>On the MGS service, Envision Blockchain would leverage the unique merits of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/artificial-intelligence-cryptocurrencies-regulatory-frenemies-making.htm">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and guided search features for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) terminology, and other standard procedures obtainable in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/decoding-web3-blockchain-laboratories-set-to-revolutionize-esg-markets-with-innovative-solutions.htm">carbon market space</a>.</p>
<p>However, this new initiative involves a third party, Swirlds Labs.</p>
<p>Applauding the MGS initiative, UNFCCC&#8217;s project executive, Massamba Thioye, stated that this service would significantly streamline and digitize climate change mitigation methodologies.</p>
<p>Thioye also said that this would significantly boost transparency, efficiency, and accessibility of the carbon markets due to the unique merits of using blockchain tech in the legacy-based space.</p>
<h2>Enhanced Data Analysis With Project Data Comparison</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Besides digitizing and reporting measurement metrics for the carbon market ecosystem, the MGS is geared toward delivering more value.</p>
<p>According to Envision Blockchain, the new initiative will come pre-designed with a new Project Data Comparison feature.</p>
<p>This will enable users to contrast data recorded as Verifiable Credentials (VCs), including the <a href="https://gbbcouncil.org/interwork-alliance-resources/mrv-framework/">Global Blockchain Business Council&#8217;s</a> (GBCC) dMRV Specification Version 2 compliant &#8216;property fields.&#8217;</p>
<p>Users will also be able to anonymously verify the authenticity of project information, supported digital signatures, and other VC data easily.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the &#8216;property fields&#8217; would offer specific, critical data points within the VCs, allowing users to have a holistic view of project data in one place.</p>
<p>In addition, project teams and users will be able to eliminate issues around double counting, thereby increasing transparency and traceability in environmentally-targeted projects.</p>
<p>This would have the long-term advantage of providing users with all the appropriate data for making smart investment decisions on viable projects.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, there has been a global emphasis on environmental awareness and sustainability measures.</p>
<p>Spearheading this initiative, COP28 creates a round-table discussion panel for world leaders and environmental experts to devise strategies aimed at safeguarding the Earth from ongoing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<h2>TON Bags KuCoin and Animoca Brands in Partnerships in Four Days</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
TON&#8217;s partnership with Kucoin serves as a potential indication of increasing momentum and interest in the development of Web3 on its network.</p>
<p>This comes shortly after Animoca Brands, a renowned gaming and metaverse-focused venture capital (VC) firm, made an <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/ton-foundation-welcomes-animoca-brands-as-ton-blockchain-largest-validator">undisclosed investment</a> in the TON system on November 28 to become the largest validator on the blockchain.</p>

<p>The gaming VC emphasized <a href="https://ton-dashboard.dat.animoca.space/">conducting thorough research</a> before committing to the TON ecosystem, leading to the creation of two research papers exploring the network&#8217;s potential to drive widespread cryptocurrency adoption.</p>
<p>The first focal point in the research is the user-friendliness of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/decentralized-applications-what-s-now-what-s-next.htm">decentralized applications</a> (dApps) and the scalability of the TON Blockchain.</p>
<p>User-friendliness is deemed crucial for attracting and retaining users in the crypto space, while scalability plays a vital role in handling increased transaction volumes and ensuring the seamless and efficient operation of the blockchain network.</p>

<p>Defunct blockchain protocol Terraform Labs is currently fighting legal challenges in Singapore and appears to be facing setbacks.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/class-action-377-parties-against-terraform-do-kwon-move-ahead-singapore-court">local news outlet</a>, the creators of the algorithmic stablecoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-founder-do-kwon-faces-new-57-million-lawsuit-where-he.htm">TerraUST</a> and its founder, Do Kwon, have had their efforts to overturn a class-action (representative action) lawsuit rejected by the High Court.</p>
<p>The High Court of Singapore ruled that the defendants failed to establish a valid arbitration agreement between them and the claimants after stating that the Terra website contained an arbitration clause.</p>
<p>The arbitration clause implies that the claimants waived their rights to a trial by jury or participation in a representative action as soon as they continued transacting on the website.</p>
<p>However, this has not been its first denial in its ongoing legal fight after the collapse of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/ethereum-outperforms-bitcoin-as-crypto-prices-climb-higher-cnbc-crypto-world.htm">blockchain network</a>. Earlier this year, the Assistant Registrar (AR) denied their motion for a stay in favor of arbitration.</p>
<p>According to the AR, the debated terms of use were located at a concealed part of Terraforms&#8217; website, and the defendants failed to highlight them properly to the claimants.</p>
<p>Consequently, its attempt to shift the representative action lawsuit to &#8220;confidential arbitration proceedings&#8221; was also denied.</p>
<p>In response, Terraform&#8217;s legal representative filed an appeal and a counterclaim, seeking substantive remedies without challenging jurisdiction.</p>
<p>However, this move was also rejected by the court, asserting that the defendants&#8217; actions indicated an acceptance of the decisions of the legal system.</p>
<h2>$57 Million Lost, and US Lawsuit Still Pending</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In September 2022, a case was filed by Julian Moreno Beltran, a Spaniard, and Douglas Gan, a Singaporean, on behalf of 375 others. The lawsuit aims to bring the blockchain protocol and its founder to trial for fraudulent misrepresentation of its UST assets.</p>
<p>The claimants alleged a collective loss of $57 million due to the illegal activities involving Terraform and its founder.</p>
<p>They also revealed that Terraform, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terra-founder-do-kwons-extradition-approved-by-montenegrin-court-heres-the-latest.htm">Do Kwon</a>, Nikolaos Alexandros Platias, and the Luna Foundation Guard (established to hold crypto reserves supporting the stability of the UST stablecoin) induced them to continue holding the asset, even as it failed to maintain its 1:1 peg to the US dollar.</p>
<p>TerraUST, which is self-described as the world&#8217;s first algorithmic <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoins-see-positive-supply-growth-for-first-time-in-more-than-a-year-glassnode-data.htm">stablecoin</a>, fell astronomically in early May 2022 following an entire ecosystem collapse kickstarted by the Anchor Protocol.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The stable yield-bearing protocol reneged on its promise to pay users a fixed 20% annual percent yield (APY) for holding UST on its platform.</p>
<p>Following this incident, investors withdrew their UST from Anchor Protocol, causing the stablecoin to plummet to an all-time low (ATL) of $0.05, despite Terraform&#8217;s attempts to salvage the situation.</p>
<p>The subsequent depegging led to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-winter-tokens.htm">crypto winter</a>, leading to the loss of over a trillion dollars in the nascent industry.</p>
<p>Companies like the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) faced financial challenges. The ripple effect was felt throughout the nascent industry, with global crypto investors witnessing significant losses within hours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also begun<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-summary-judgment-in-do-kwon-fraud-case.htm"> legal action</a> against Terraform and its founder.</p>
<p>The SEC claimed that Terraform&#8217;s collapse resulted in the wiping out of billions of dollars of American investors&#8217; money. The US regulator charged the blockchain network with fraud for selling unregistered securities.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>In November, the cryptocurrency industry experienced significant losses, with bug bounty platform Immunefi reporting that over $343 million was lost to platform hacks and fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This marks the <a href="https://immunefi.com/research/">highest monthly loss</a> recorded in the emerging industry for 2023.</p>
<p>Detailing the extent of the loss, <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/5dTC8oeUNH5vdahpW0phvN/da7b943a587e8019daeea6774c20b130/Immunefi_Crypto_Losses_In_November_2023.pdf">Immunefi&#8217;s report</a> reveals that the $343 million loss is a 15.4 times increase compared to the over $22.1 million recorded in October 2023.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">November saw $343 million lost to crypto hacks and fraud cases: Immunefi.</p>
<p>&mdash; Thecryptopreacher. (@Rumerule) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rumerule/status/1730272659710112193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Crypto hacks contributed the largest share to this record, with malicious actors making away with a total of $335,574,150 across 18 specific incidents. Crypto frauds accounted for a total of $7,464,660, recorded in 23 specific incidents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Immunefi pointed out that centralized finance (CeFi) platforms accounted for the most losses in November 2023. CeFi platforms lost $184,440,000 across four separate incidents, representing a whopping 53.8% of the total losses for the month.</p>
<p>The leading bug bounty platform associates this significant spike to the hacks of Justin Sun&#8217;s Poloniex, <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1706311251024822748">HTX</a> (formerly Huobi Global), and Taiwanese venture capital firm <a href="https://x.com/ResearchKronos/status/1726013733888041376?s=20">Kronos Research</a> platforms.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The trio lost a combined value of over $132.9 million from three separate malicious attacks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem also experienced notable losses, totaling $158,638,810 across 37 separate incidents. This accounted for the remaining 46.2% loss.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-138154" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-138154" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701369509-crypto-losses.png" alt="" width="1200" height="544" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701369509-crypto-losses.png 917w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701369509-crypto-losses-300x136.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1701369509-crypto-losses-768x348.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-138154" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: Immunefi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given the sizable market share the Ethereum blockchain and BNB Chain enjoy in the decentralized economy, the robust smart contract networks were the leaders in the most impacted chains in the report.</p>
<p>According to Immunefi, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-layer-2-blast-closes-in-on-solana-after-reaching-600-million-tvl-in-10-days.htm">Ethereum</a> and the BNB Chain had a combined 34 separate incidents, accounting for 83% of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/decentralized-applications-what-s-now-what-s-next.htm">decentralized applications</a> (dApps) on their platform.</p>
<p>Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism suffered three incidents (7.3%) and one incident (2.4%).</p>
<p>Other smart contract networks, including Avalanche, Fantom, and Heco Chain, witnessed one incident (2.4%) each.</p>
<h2>Over $1.7 Billion Lost in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The crypto market has become a target for numerous cyber threat groups, with the state-backed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lazarus-groups-new-malware-harder-detect-cyber-security-firm-warns-crypto-firms.htm">Lazarus Group</a> leading the pack. This group has successfully stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from inadequately secured blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>Despite a challenging start to 2023, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/900-million-been-stolen-crypto-hacks-year.htm">crypto hacks</a> and frauds show no signs of slowing down. Immunefi reports that the nascent industry has incurred losses exceeding $1.7 billion year-to-date, spread across 296 separate incidents.</p>
<p>Highlighting the months with the highest crypto hack activities, the bug bounty platform ranks November as the highest, followed by September with $340 million in recorded losses, and July securing the third position with $320 million.</p>

<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius has opened withdrawals for eligible custody customers starting November 29, according to a statement on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Beginning today, additional withdrawals for Eligible Custody Users are now available. Please note that the only assets currently available for withdrawal are certain Custody Assets; all other cryptocurrency remains unavailable for withdrawal at this time.</p>
<p>&mdash; Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/CelsiusNetwork/status/1729879423024062484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174911292380000000040.pdf">court filing on November 28</a>, &#8220;Celsius eligible custody users&#8221; are customers with &#8220;Class 6A General Custody Claims and/or Class 6B Withdrawable Custody Claim.&#8221; These users can withdraw 72.5% of their crypto holdings, excluding transaction fees, until February 28.</p>
<p>However, only specific custody assets are currently available for withdrawal, while all other cryptocurrencies remain inaccessible.</p>
<p>For a seamless process, Celsius urged users to withdraw their assets from the Celsius app and make personal records of any information they may find useful, emphasizing that the app will only be available for a limited time.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We strongly encourage you to withdraw these assets from the Celsius app and take personal records of information you may find useful immediately, as the Celsius app  will only be available for a limited time.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite these instructions, customers have encountered various issues during withdrawal attempts.</p>
<p>A user on X, ChazzonKe, stated that the crypto lender platform had 17 months to prepare and launch a withdrawal access portal, yet customers are now facing difficulties logging into their accounts via the app.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hearing reports that social logins are having issues on the celsius app along with other login methods. Additionally, it seems transfers have already begun to get slowed down for &quot;security&quot; reasons.  17 months to prepare, and per tradition, they drop the ball.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Celsius Newco Community also pointed out failed attempts to log in via Facebook.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It is absolutely outrageous that Custody creditors with Facebook login will not be able to withdraw their digital assets today because the Celsius so-called developers are not able to fix it.<a href="https://twitter.com/CelsiusUcc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CelsiusUcc</a> please do your job and demand an IMMEDIATE resolution and communicate daily…</p>

<p>However, Celsius foresaw recent customer complaints related to withdrawal and login issues. The company&#8217;s court filing acknowledged their anticipation of a high volume of withdrawal requests.</p>
<p>While committing to ensuring accurate and secure withdrawals, the platform noted that, due to the expected demand, not all withdrawals may be processed immediately upon request.</p>
<h2>Celsius Bankruptcy and Formation of Mining NewCo</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In July 2022, Celsius filed for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220713005911/en/Celsius-Network-Initiates-Financial-Restructuring-to-Stabilize-Business-and-Maximize-Value-for-All-Stakeholders">Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a>, closely followed by the suspension of withdrawals on its platform.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Moments ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/CelsiusNetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CelsiusNetwork</a> filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 protection and announced that the company initiated a financial restructuring. <a href="https://t.co/vf5wsT6TMp">https://t.co/vf5wsT6TMp</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Subsequently, on July 13, 2023, the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-133">filed a lawsuit</a> against Celsius and its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, alleging misconduct related to the Earn Interest Program. Mashinsky faces multiple charges, including securities fraud, with his trial scheduled to begin in September 2024.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s collapse was attributed to Mashinsky&#8217;s trading decisions, mismanagement of $2 billion in assets, and ineffective systems for tracking these assets.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-celsius-ceo-alex-mashinskys-criminal-trial-set-for-september-2024.htm">Mashinsky</a> argued that the rapid growth of Celsius&#8217; assets surpassed the company&#8217;s ability to make prudent investment decisions, leading to poorly judged asset deployments.</p>
<p>On November 20, Celsius and its debtors <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231120725219/en/Celsius-to-Transition-to-Mining-Only-NewCo-following-Bankruptcy-Court%E2%80%99s-Confirmation-of-Plan">agreed to transition</a> into a Bitcoin miner as part of its reconstruction process.</p>

<p>This foundation, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), is duly registered with the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) financial authority.</p>
<p>To commence the foundation&#8217;s operations, IOTA disclosed that it would be seeded with $100 million in its native IOTA tokens over a four-year period and released in scheduled tranches.</p>
<p>The $100 million would be focused on facilitating the foundation&#8217;s activities and accelerating the growth of the DAG data structure protocol in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Highlighting its overarching goals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, IOTA stated that the foundation aims to cultivate valuable relationships and work towards the adoption of its protocol and its staging network, Shimmer, across various sectors in the selected territory.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://blog.iota.org/iota-first-dlt-registered-adgm-in-uae/">blog post</a>, IOTA outlined its plans to forge partnerships with institutional investors, governments, and academic institutions to boost the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).</p>
<p>The objective is to onboard these RWAs onto the blockchain and drive much-needed capital into the UAE&#8217;s virtual assets landscape.</p>
<p>Speaking on the remarkable development, the CEO of the Registration Authority (RA) of the ADGM, Hamad Sayah Al Mazrouei, stated that the IOTA Ecosystem DLT Foundation is a testament to the region&#8217;s ambition to become a prime location for the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>Mazrouei also noted that the ADGM is mapping out a future where it sets the right global benchmarks in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/abu-dhabi-global-market-unveils-new-regulations-for-web3-firms.htm">Web3 landscape</a>.</p>
<p>IOTA&#8217;s DLT Ecosystem Foundation is the first-ever blockchain initiative getting the green light from the region&#8217;s international financial center (IFC).</p>
<p>Launched in 2015, the ADGM plays a crucial role in serving as a strategic hub for linking growing economies in the Middle East, South Asia, Africa, and the rest of the world.</p>
<h2>IOTA Evolving From Enterprise to Competitive Layer-1 Protocol</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
IOTA describes itself as the next step in the evolution of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-blockchain-technology-empowers-law-enforcement-crypto-investigations.htm">blockchain technology</a>. Departing from the conventional reliance on blocks for data storage, it adopts an innovative Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure that increases transaction output while minimizing potential costs.</p>
<p>IOTA&#8217;s focus has largely been enterprise-driven since its debut in 2015. However, a notable shift is underway with the introduction of its Abu Dhabi Foundation.</p>
<p>Corroborating a paradigm change in its operational framework, the IOTA team disclosed that the DLT Foundation would automatically transition it into a competitive layer-1 blockchain protocol within the Web3 and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">cryptocurrency</a> space.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>To achieve this, the first quarter (Q1) of 2024 will see the protocol become Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible. This compatibility will facilitate the smooth operation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-l2-protocol-blast-faces-scrutiny-as-paradigm-raises-concerns-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Ethereum</a> developers and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/unpacking-the-applications-of-decentralized-social-networks-w-will-papper-and-ian-lee-of-syndicate.htm">decentralized applications</a> (dApps) on the IOTA platform.</p>

<p>Additionally, the IOTA protocol would launch its first RWAs within that same timeframe as it seeks to onboard institutional investors.</p>

<p>Interoperable blockchain protocol Wormhole has achieved another significant milestone with a $225 million seed fund raised from a group of prominent investors in the crypto landscape.</p>
<p>This fundraising is the largest in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/throughout-one-of-the-toughest-crypto-bear-markets-yet-a-web3-hub-is-born-in-new-york.htm">Web3 ecosystem</a> so far this year, propelling Wormhole&#8217;s market valuation to $2.5 billion.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Key investors in this funding round include Brevan Howard, Coinbase Ventures, Multicoin Capital, Jump Trading, ParaFi, Dialectic, Borderless Capital, Arrington Capital, and undisclosed entities.</p>
<p>Together, these investors have provided the necessary liquidity to propel the protocol to its next development stage.</p>
<p>The platform also <a href="https://wormhole.com/wormhole-secures-225-million-in-funding-round/">announced the launch</a> of Wormhole Labs in a blog post – an independent blockchain company creating products, tools, and reference implementations to foster cross-chain activity and development.</p>
<p>Providing more details, the Wormhole team stated that the new company will significantly contribute to the overall success of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, the allocation of the $225 million between Wormhole Labs, Wormhole, and the Wormhole Foundation – an entity created to attract developer interest to the protocol – was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Currently, Wormhole&#8217;s immediate focus is on expanding its team through new hires to its 15-man operation.</p>
<p>Officially launched in 2021 as a developer messaging technology, Wormhole has expanded its services to over 30 blockchain networks.</p>
<p>The platform enables multiple use cases spanning decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and community-driven governance.</p>
<p>Over its two-year existence, Wormhole has facilitated over $35 billion in asset transfers across its supported protocols.</p>
<p>The platform offers a suite of blockchain-driven products, with the <a href="https://wormhole.com/messaging/?ref=wormhole.ghost.io">Wormhole Messaging protocol</a> playing a critical role.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://wormhole.com/connect/?ref=wormhole.ghost.io">Wormhole Connect</a> product enables developers to access an in-app bridging widget that can be integrated with any decentralized application (dApp) in as little as three lines of code.</p>
<h2>Rocky Journey, Not Rocky Destination</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite being in operation for two years, the Wormhole team has been coy on releasing its native token.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the team is laser-focused on delivering the most value for its institutional clients and end-users and is committed to increasing its daily 2 million cross-chain messages.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest fundraising event, Wormhole Foundation&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer Dan Reecer stated that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/ready-layer-1-blockchain-protocol-pioneers-crypto-bahamas.htm">blockchain protocol</a> is keen on creating the right framework for developers to build with their tools and enrich the experience of their end-users down the line.</p>
<p>However, the journey for the protocol hasn&#8217;t always been smooth. The platform, incubated by Jump Trading in its inception, was hacked for $320 million (120,000 wETH) in February 2022 by malicious actors through its Solana bridge.</p>
<p>Despite the setback, the parent company promptly refunded the lost funds, but the incident left a lingering impact on investor sentiment.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The wormhole network was exploited for 120k wETH. </p>
<p>ETH will be added over the next hours to ensure wETH is backed 1:1. More details to come shortly.</p>
<p>We are working to get the network back up quickly. Thanks for your patience.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/blockchain-and-crypto-space-in-dubai.htm">crypto space</a> is evolving rapidly, and Wormhole is demonstrating resilience in overcoming its challenges.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Saeed Badreg affirmed the platform&#8217;s continued focus on facilitating efficient blockchain-to-blockchain communication even after a challenging 2022.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>dYdX Chain,  dubbed dYdX v4 and <a href="https://dydx.exchange/blog/dydx-chain">announced last year</a>, is a standalone blockchain protocol built on the famous Cosmos software development kit (SDK) and the Tendermint <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-narratives-about-ethereum-and-its-merge-with-its-proof-of-stake-beacon-chain.htm">proof-of-stake</a> (PoS) consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>Having transitioned out of its beta stage, dYdX Chain users can now claim their trading fee rewards. 75.6% of community members staked over 7.7 million DYDX tokens to kickstart the distribution process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 24.4% of its members voted against this decision, and they staked 2.51 million of the exchange’s tokens to make their opposition heard.</p>
<p>As a crypto derivatives trading protocol, dYdX Chain allows users to engage in the buying and selling of digital assets in a permissionless manner. It also provides a sizable 20x in leverage.</p>
<p>Additionally, traders have access to 33 permissionless trading markets following the full-scale commencement of the platform on November 14.</p>
<p>The governance vote, which commenced on November 24 and ended on November 28, also covers the decisions of stakers and network validators.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dydx-chain-kickstarts-operations-with-beta-mainnet-launch.htm">dYdX Chain</a> community deposited up to 10 million DYDX tokens, and the online voting event had a 62.3% turnout success.</p>
<p>Validators and stakers are scheduled to receive rewards in the form of the USDC stablecoin and the native DYDX tokens.</p>
<h2>Six-Month Incentive Program Approved</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since its beta mainnet launch on November 14, 2023, dYdX Chain has recorded over 14,000 transactions totaling $1.4 million. However, this figure is relatively conservative, given the limited availability of derivatives trading pairs for investors.</p>
<p>Presently, traders can only trade BTC/USD, ETH/USD, SOL/USD, and LINK/USD pairs, with the development team actively working to broaden the market scope and attract a more diverse user base.</p>
<p>The dYdX community voted for the passage of a six-month incentive program following a snapshot <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x6a6bfecb96304c6568affa4bbf07081a70c18fd56754ffb82ee53d61d3039416">proposal by Chaos Lab</a>.</p>
<p>The incentive program is geared towards boosting the derivatives trading platform’s trading activities in terms of volume and also to draw traders to the dYdX Chain.</p>
<p>In terms of financial output, the program has earmarked $20 million payable in DYDX tokens from the dYdX Chain Community Treasury.</p>
<p>Providing a reason behind this program, the proposal aims to recognize early adopters of the dYdX v4 platform to raise much-needed liquidity and boost platform traffic.</p>
<p>Moreover, given the growing competition from other permissionless trading hubs, the incentive program is a means of marketing the derivative protocol to the wider <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-46-5-of-web3-fund-loss-is-result-of-traditional-web2-security-issues-investment-in-blockchain-gaming-hits-1-5-billion-in-2023.htm">Web3 ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>To address concerns related to wash trading, the program will implement measures to detect and deter such activities on the dYdX Chain.</p>
<p>There will also be a transparent risk and analytics portal that will allow community members to effortlessly verify the activities of all users receiving rewards.</p>
<p>To participate in this reward scheme, users are required to trade, stake, deposit, and participate in governance activities.</p>

<p>Customers of these banks will now be able to transfer and withdraw the state-backed tokenized currency through their respective integrations with the e-CNY platform.</p>
<p>To enhance adoption and accessibility, <a href="https://www.cs.com.cn/yh/04/202311/t20231127_6377869.html">Hang Seng Bank</a> now allows customers to link their debit cards to the official Chinese e-CNY mobile app and redeem the CBDC asset. Deposits can also be made through the official Hang Seng mobile banking app.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.cnstock.com/news,bwkx-202311-5156386.htm">Hong Kong&#8217;s HSBC</a> also provides similar access options, while the <a href="http://www.zqrb.cn/jrjg/hlwjr/2023-11-28/A1701140979863.html">Taiwanese Fubon Bank</a> enables customers to fund their accounts with e-CNY using its mobile banking platform. Fubon customers can also make payments for goods and services using e-CNY via bank cards.</p>
<p>e-CNY is China&#8217;s answer to the growing penetration of blockchain technology into the financial landscape. Although the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) is anti-crypto, the Asian nation has fully embraced the benefits of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-technology-developments.htm">distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT).</p>
<p>The launch of e-CNY (or the digital renminbi) aligns with China&#8217;s goal of facilitating convenient payment access for domestic and international trade.</p>
<h2>Digital Euro Plans Ongoing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
China has not wasted time in putting its CBDC to the test. According to an <a href="https://www.shpgx.com/html/zxdt/20231020/5555.html">announcement last month</a> by the Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange (SHPGX), PetroChina International successfully purchased 1 million barrels of oil using the digital renminbi.</p>

<p>Locked crypto assets valued at $750 million are set for release by December 2023, according to data gathered from the Token Unlocks platform.</p>
<p>A total of four decentralized blockchain protocols are looking to saturate the crypto market with their digital tokens.</p>
<p>Among these blockchain networks, the renowned decentralized exchange, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-22-dydx-thorchain-fetch-ai.htm">dYdX</a>, is scheduled to make the most significant release.</p>
<p>In an official announcement on X (formerly Twitter), the peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto asset platform disclosed its plan to release about 150 million tokens on December 1, 2023, at 12:00 noon UTC.</p>
<p>These digital tokens, valued at about $500 million in current market rates, were initially locked by investors, the founding team, and developers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>dYdX Trading Inc., dYdX Foundation and certain parties to the Warrants to Purchase Tokens signed an amendment to, among other things, postpone the initial release date applicable to investor <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DYDX&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$DYDX</a> tokens to Dec 1, 2023</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The vested tokens were divided into 27.7% for past investors of dYdX Trading Inc., with founders, employees, advisors, and consultants getting 15.3% for both dYdX Trading Inc. and the dYdX Foundation.</p>
<p>Beyond the December 1 vesting release, dYdX has outlined a schedule to release 40% of its tokens in equal monthly installments from January 1 to June 1, 2024.</p>
<p>An additional 20% will be released from June 1 to June 1, 2025, and the final tranche of vested tokens will be completed by June 1, 2026, as indicated in <a href="https://www.dydx.foundation/blog/lock-up-extension">dYdX&#8217;s blog post</a>.</p>
<p>While dYdX leads the token release circle, other protocols are also introducing a sizable amount of vested tokens into the crypto market.</p>
<p>The popular automated market maker (AMM) protocol, 1Inch Network, <a href="https://token.unlocks.app/1inch">plans to release</a> 98.74 million 1INCH tokens on the same day as dYdX.</p>
<p>This will see 9.48% of its total supply hitting the market. The digital tokens are currently worth $33.76 million at the current price of the 1INCH asset.</p>
<p>Ethereum layer-2 protocol Optimism will also <a href="https://token.unlocks.app/optimism">unlock 24.16 million of its OP tokens</a>, worth about $41.55 million, by November 30. This will see a total of 2.74% of its over 4.2 billion total supply, making an entry into the crypto market.</p>
<p>Rounding up the mix is <a href="https://aptos.dev/aptos-white-paper/">Move prover-powered</a> proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain protocol <a href="https://token.unlocks.app/aptos">Aptos</a>, which is set to undergo a token emission in excess of 24.84 million APT tokens, representing 8.97% of its circulating supply.</p>
<p>This release represents 8.97% of its circulating supply, with the tokens valued at $171.41 million.</p>
<h2>Broader Market Performance Somewhat Bearish</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">crypto market</a> witnessed a significant downturn since the 2022 winter kicked off in May 2022 following the collapse of the Terra blockchain protocol.</p>
<p>Within a 12-month period, the nascent industry experienced an over 50% decline from its peak of $2.92 trillion, struggling to maintain a $1 trillion capitalization through much of the year.</p>
<p>Currently, the market dynamics are gradually shifting towards a bullish trend. This trend is currently being led by the foremost crypto asset, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-user-claims-hack-triggered-record-3m-bitcoin-fee-139-btc-lost.htm">Bitcoin</a>, which has since climbed above $35,000, given growing interest from mainstream legacy financial institutions.</p>
<p>Despite this positive momentum, the nascent industry still faces challenges, with its current market valuation stuck at $1.4 trillion after a 1.94% decrease in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>However, the bearish trend has not dampened the growing interest in the nascent industry. Data from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">CoinMarketCap</a> reveals that the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index (used to measure market sentiment) indicates strong greed among investors, with a 72.83 mark.</p>

<p>As a result, the scheduled token releases would likely have little impact on the long-term performance of the broader crypto market.</p>

<p>Following his appointment as the new CEO of the world&#8217;s largest crypto asset exchange on November 22, Richard Teng has outlined his vision for the platform going forward.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-our-ceo/my-first-blog-as-binances-ceo-2887294642016890803">first-ever blog post</a>, Teng revealed that the Binance exchange would be focused on contributing to the development of a globally harmonized regulatory framework. This framework will foster innovation within the Web3 ecosystem while directly protecting consumer interests.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here is my first blog as <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> CEO.</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to share immediate focus areas, discuss our responsibility to users and my view on the future of our industry.<a href="https://t.co/c6QMS6Ulmm">https://t.co/c6QMS6Ulmm</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) <a href="https://twitter.com/_RichardTeng/status/1729113287667970052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Teng, who formerly served as Binance&#8217;s Global Head of Regional Markets, stated that the exchange is now entering an era of &#8220;responsible growth&#8221; where it would focus on engaging in meaningful discourse with global policymakers.</p>
<p>According to him, this would serve as a form of social contract between the exchange and its 160 million customers, demonstrating a serious commitment to creating a secure environment for digital asset trading.</p>
<p>Before joining Binance, Teng spent 13 years with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). He also held roles as the Chief Regulatory Officer of the SGX platform and later as the CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) with the Abu Dhabi Global Market.</p>
<p>Teng&#8217;s comments come amidst regulatory challenges faced by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-us-guilty-plea-may-raise-complications-for-hong-kong-affiliates-crypto-license-application-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">the Binance exchange</a> in recent months.</p>
<p>Following a multi-year investigation by the US Department of Justice (DoJ), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and two other US agencies, Binance was found guilty of money laundering, sanctions violations, and various financial breaches.</p>
<p>The crypto asset platform was fined $4.3 billion in penalties.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (popularly called CZ) was not <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-coin-price-prediction-as-changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-after-doj-settlement-will-bnb-rally-or-dump-now.htm">spared of these blushes</a>.</p>
<p>CZ was required to step down from his role and was fined $50 million in bail given his violation of the US Bank Secrecy Act.</p>
<p>He has since been released after meeting his bail bond and is scheduled for a trial early next year.</p>
<p>The Binance exchange is also currently being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for fraudulent activities, terrorist financing, and 11 other charges.</p>
<h2>Proof of Reserves Still Strong, But Outflows Being Recorded</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In an effort to reassure investors about the platform&#8217;s ongoing commitment to asset security, Teng noted that the exchange takes its role as the custodian of users&#8217; assets seriously.</p>
<p>According to him, each user&#8217;s digital assets are backed 1:1. Despite legal challenges, Binance&#8217;s proof of reserves, a report of its crypto assets portfolio, remains unquestioned. However, retail outflows are being recorded on a massive scale.</p>
<p>According to blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant data, Binance&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptoquant-reports-decline-in-binances-bitcoin-reserves-as-retail-flow-shifts-to-coinbase.htm">Bitcoin reserves have since shrunk</a> to 5,000 BTCs in the past week.</p>
<p>In contrast, the US-based Coinbase exchange has seen its figure balloon to 12,000 Bitcoins within the same window.</p>

<p>Sharing possible reasons for this sharp contrast, CryptoQuant noted that Coinbase&#8217;s strong regulatory background and Nasdaq trading experience have served as possible factors for growing confidence in its ability to properly safeguard investors&#8217; assets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Coinbase exchange has been earmarked by several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applicants like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-files-spot-ether-etf-application.htm">BlackRock</a>, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, Ark Invest, and several others as their Bitcoin custodians.</p>
<p>This has contributed to a positive shift in sentiments toward the 11-year-old exchange.<br />

<p>Coinbase is experiencing a swift turnaround in its fortunes following a significant rally in its stock price.</p>
<p>Listed on the Nasdaq trading floor, the COIN stock price has rallied over 49%, according to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/6zpRYSXI/?symbol=NASDAQ%3ACOIN">data from TradingView</a>.</p>
<p>The crypto-backed stock started November at $77 but has since skyrocketed to $115.93 in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>This strong bullish momentum is the highest price COIN has attained since May 2022, after which the nascent crypto market went into a year-long bearish run.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136401" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136401" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136401" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700852041-coin_2023-11-24_18-25-57.png" alt="COIN" width="1200" height="626" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700852041-coin_2023-11-24_18-25-57.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700852041-coin_2023-11-24_18-25-57-300x157.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700852041-coin_2023-11-24_18-25-57-1024x534.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700852041-coin_2023-11-24_18-25-57-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136401" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: Trading View</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>COIN has since rallied above its 50-day moving average (MA) price of $82.42; its 200-day MA price of $72.62 is also positively bullish.</p>
<p>The stock has also broken into the overbought zone in its relative strength index (RSI) following a figure of 82.83.</p>
<p>Despite these gains, COIN&#8217;s current price remains substantially lower than its 2021 listing price. The exchange&#8217;s stock reached an all-time high (ATH) of $350 before experiencing a significant decline in early 2022 due to industry-wide market downturns.</p>
<p>Now, COIN is looking to make a comeback given its key role in the ongoing race for a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-hype-rally-weekly-inflows-66-million-investors-remain-bullish-solana-report.htm">spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF) approval for several legacy-based asset management firms.</p>
<p>Major investment giants, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-macro-weekly-ether-eth-pumps-11-above-2100-as-blackrock-files-for-spot-ethereum-etf-as-broader-market-rally-continues.htm">BlackRock</a>, Ark Invest, Grayscale, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and Fidelity, have submitted spot Bitcoin ETF applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>A common factor among all applicants is the inclusion of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-update-coinbase-opens-btc-and-eth-futures-to-us-retail-investors-roe-nears-stage-3-of-its-presale.htm">Coinbase</a> as a custodian for their Bitcoin holdings.</p>
<p>A spot Bitcoin ETF essentially provides a secure avenue for mainstream investors to enter the crypto space through traditional financial and regulated entities, mitigating concerns about crypto scams and fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>While this is not the first attempt at a spot Bitcoin ETF filing, the SEC, led by Gary Gensler, has consistently rejected such proposals, citing concerns about market manipulation, inaccurate data curation services, and a lack of robust investor protection mechanisms.</p>
<p>However, market analysts suggest a significant shift, estimating a 90% chance of SEC approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF early next year.</p>

<h2>Binance&#8217;s Bitcoin Reserves While Coinbase Surges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Coinbase has recently emerged as a winner on multiple fronts. According to <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/655e0b13ddc9c407ec318873-BTC-moving-from-Binance-to-Coinbase-Pro?utm_source=telegram&amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=Quicktake&amp;utm_content=Gaah">data from CryptoQuant</a>, Binance&#8217;s Bitcoin reserves dropped to 5,000 BTC, while Coinbase&#8217;s holdings surged to 12,000 Bitcoins within a short timeframe.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptoquant-reports-decline-in-binances-bitcoin-reserves-as-retail-flow-shifts-to-coinbase.htm">CryptoQuant</a> attributed these changes to retail outflows directly shifting from Binance to Coinbase Pro, signaling a noteworthy transformation in the dynamics of crypto leadership.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Offering insight into these developments, CryptoQuant stated that many institutional players are opting for the Coinbase platform for trading and asset custody.</p>
<p>This shift is attributed to Coinbase&#8217;s Nasdaq listing and robust regulatory coverage, providing a secure haven for investors to protect against any shortfall.</p>
<p>The Binance exchange was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-coin-price-prediction-as-changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-after-doj-settlement-will-bnb-rally-or-dump-now.htm">recently fined</a> $4.3 billion by four US government agencies, including the Department of Justice (DoJ), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and two others.</p>
